Feel free to fork the project and add new features. I am happy to manage clean pull requests. And in case you are good with embedded development, but need some help with git: Just drop me a message here on github. We will get your improvemnts into the master branch.

Please keep in mind, that changes should be

1. In a coherent coding style
2. Just add features without dropping others
3. For mutually exclusive features, add a define to toggle during build
4. Should benefit others, and not only your specific setup
5. Use english in your code for comments and variable names
6. If you need to introduce a global variable, prefix it with `g_`.

Of course, even if you add a mega specific feature, which I can not merge into master, publish it in your fork.
There are chances someone else might need excatly that one feature and you could make him very happy ;-)

Seeing how my code and commits are not exactly high quality (compared to code I write for my job), I am not mega strict on pull requests as this might sound.
